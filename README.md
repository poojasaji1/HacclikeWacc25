## SteganoStorage
StegnoStorage uses stegnanography to hide messages and files in images that do not look suspicious. Stegnanography is the practice of using images, files, or text to hide messages. It is sometimes associated with cryptography (the practice of using codes to hide messages and other information), but the difference is that stegnanography works to conceal any suspicion in the generated files (while crytography does not).
