## SteganoStorage
SteganoStorage uses steganography to hide messages and files in images that do not look suspicious. Steganography is the practice of using images, files, or text to hide messages. It is sometimes associated with cryptography (the practice of using codes to hide messages and other information), but the difference is that steganography works to conceal any suspicion in the generated files (while crytography does not).

## Design and Features
The goal for SteganoStorage is to be a application that can be quickly used to hide messages and files in images. The user can then keep these images on their device for fast access if needed. 
SteganoStorage is a website that can be accessed on computer and mobile. 

Encryption Feature
> When the website is pulled up, the user is prompted to enter the text or file they would like hidden. They then are given a selection of images to choose from, and the chosen image will be where the text/file is hidden. They can then save this image for (potential) future use.

Decryption Feature
> Users also have the opportunity to upload images to figure out the message hidden in them.

Resources
> We will provide several resources for domestic violence and abuse survivors, so they know who they can reach out to.

## Future Directions
Because of time constraints, we made the design of the website easy to understand in relation to the purpose. This might be too direct or obvious for users who may need to use this application but cannot be obvious about it, such as those in domestic violence situations. In the future, we'd like to make the application appear less conspicuous so those in DV situations will feel more comfortable using it.
